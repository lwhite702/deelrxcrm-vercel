# Privacy Aliases

DeelRxCRM offers optional privacy aliases powered by SimpleLogin to help protect your email address while using our platform.

## What are Privacy Aliases?

Privacy aliases are temporary email addresses that forward messages to your real email address. This allows you to:

- **Protect your primary email** from being directly associated with your DeelRxCRM account
- **Maintain privacy** in business communications
- **Control email forwarding** by disabling aliases when needed
- **Reduce spam** by using unique addresses for different services

## Using Privacy Aliases

### During Signup

When creating your DeelRxCRM account:

1. Navigate to the signup page
2. Look for the "Generate Private Alias" button below the email field
3. Click to automatically create a privacy alias
4. The generated alias will fill your email field
5. Complete signup as normal

**Alternative**: You can still use your regular email address by typing it directly into the email field.

### Managing Your Aliases

After signup, manage your aliases in **Settings â†’ Account**:

- **View active aliases** with delivery status
- **Monitor alias health** and bounce rates
- **Disable unwanted aliases**
- **See creation dates** and usage notes

## Important Limitations

<Warning>
**Privacy aliases are optional and come with important limitations:**

- **No anonymity guarantee** - Aliases provide privacy, not complete anonymity
- **Third-party dependency** - Relies on SimpleLogin service availability  
- **Delivery not guaranteed** - Email forwarding may occasionally fail
- **User responsibility** - You must maintain access to your aliases
- **Legal compliance** - You are responsible for lawful use of aliases
</Warning>

## How It Works

1. **Alias Creation**: When you request an alias, we create one through SimpleLogin
2. **Email Forwarding**: Messages sent to your alias automatically forward to your real email
3. **Health Monitoring**: We monitor alias delivery and alert you to issues
4. **Automatic Protection**: Aliases with repeated delivery failures are automatically disabled

## Delivery Status Indicators

Your aliases show different status indicators:

- **ðŸŸ¢ OK**: Alias is working normally
- **ðŸŸ¡ Warning**: Some delivery issues detected
- **ðŸ”´ Error**: Significant delivery problems
- **âš« Disabled**: Alias has been deactivated

## Troubleshooting

### Alias Creation Fails

If you can't generate an alias during signup:
- Use your regular email address instead
- Try again later - the service may be temporarily unavailable
- Contact support if the issue persists

### Not Receiving Emails

If emails aren't reaching you through your alias:
1. Check your spam folder
2. Verify your alias is still active in Settings
3. Ensure your real email address is working
4. Contact support for assistance

### Alias Automatically Disabled

If your alias is automatically disabled:
- This happens after repeated delivery failures
- Check your email account for capacity or filtering issues
- Consider switching to your regular email address
- Re-enable through Settings once issues are resolved

## Privacy & Security

### What We Store

- The alias email address
- Connection to your account
- Delivery status and health metrics
- Creation date and notes

### What We Don't Store

- Your real email address (beyond login purposes)
- Message content passing through aliases
- Personal communications or metadata

### Data Protection

- All alias data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Access is limited to your account and authorized administrators
- Data is retained only as long as necessary for service operation
- You can request alias deletion at any time

## Best Practices

### When to Use Aliases

- **New service signups** where you want privacy
- **Business communications** that may generate marketing emails
- **Trial accounts** or temporary usage
- **Situations** where you want to control future communications

### When to Use Regular Email

- **Critical business communications** where delivery is essential
- **Account recovery** purposes (we recommend keeping a regular email as backup)
- **High-volume communications** where forwarding delays matter
- **Long-term accounts** where you need guaranteed access
