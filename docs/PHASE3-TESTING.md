# Phase 3 Integration Testing Suite

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for Phase 3 features including test cases, scenarios, and validation procedures.

## Testing Overview

Phase 3 introduces complex business logic requiring thorough integration testing across:
- Credit Management System
- Knowledge Base Operations  
- Dual Blob Storage
- Background Job Processing
- Database Schema Integration

## Test Categories

### 1. Database Integration Tests

#### Schema Validation
- ✅ All Phase 3 tables created successfully
- ✅ Foreign key relationships properly configured
- ✅ Enum values correctly defined
- ✅ Index creation for performance

#### Data Integrity Tests
- Team-based data isolation
- Foreign key constraint validation
- Type conversion accuracy (string teamId → integer)
- UUID format validation for customers/articles

### 2. API Integration Tests

#### Credit Management APIs
**Test Cases:**
- Create/update credit accounts
- Process credit transactions
- Stripe payment integration
- Balance calculation accuracy
- Transaction idempotency

**Validation Scenarios:**
```bash
# Test credit account creation
POST /api/teams/123/credit
{
  "customerId": "uuid-here",
  "creditLimit": 10000,
  "status": "active"
}

# Test transaction processing
POST /api/teams/123/credit/transactions
{
  "creditId": "uuid-here",
  "transactionType": "charge",
  "amount": 500,
  "description": "Service charge"
}
```

#### Knowledge Base APIs
**Test Cases:**
- Article CRUD operations
- File upload with dual storage
- Draft → Review → Published workflow
- Team-based access control

**Validation Scenarios:**
```bash
# Test article creation
POST /api/help/articles
{
  "teamId": 123,
  "title": "Test Article",
  "content": "Article content",
  "status": "draft"
}

# Test file upload
POST /api/help/uploads
FormData: file, teamId, context=kb-article
```

### 3. Blob Storage Integration Tests

#### Dual Storage Validation
**Test Cases:**
- Automatic store type selection
- Private vs public file routing
- File migration between stores
- Access control validation

**Test Scenarios:**
- Upload invoice (should go to private store)
- Upload public guide (should go to public store)
- Migrate file from public to private
- Verify access permissions

### 4. Background Job Integration Tests

#### Inngest Job Processing
**Test Cases:**
- Credit reminder jobs
- KB cleanup jobs
- Link verification jobs
- Job retry logic

**Validation:**
- Jobs execute on schedule
- Error handling works correctly
- Database updates properly applied
- External API calls succeed

## Automated Test Execution

### Test Database Setup
```bash
# Set up test database
export DATABASE_URL="test_database_url"
npm run db:push

# Seed test data
npm run test:seed
```

### API Testing
```bash
# Run API integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Test specific endpoints
npm run test:api -- --grep "credit"
npm run test:api -- --grep "knowledge-base"
```

## Manual Testing Scenarios

### End-to-End User Workflows

#### Credit Management Workflow
1. **Setup Phase**
   - Create team and customer
   - Initialize credit account
   - Set credit limit

2. **Transaction Phase**
   - Create charge transaction
   - Process payment
   - Verify balance updates

3. **Monitoring Phase**
   - Check transaction history
   - Verify email notifications
   - Test payment reminders

#### Knowledge Base Workflow
1. **Content Creation**
   - Create draft article
   - Upload supporting files
   - Move to review status

2. **Publishing**
   - Publish article
   - Verify public accessibility
   - Test search functionality

3. **Maintenance**
   - Update article content
   - Manage file attachments
   - Archive old content

## Performance Testing

### Database Performance
- Query execution times under load
- Connection pool efficiency
- Index usage optimization

### API Response Times
- Credit calculation performance
- File upload speeds
- Bulk operations efficiency

### Background Job Performance
- Job processing times
- Queue depth management
- Resource utilization

## Security Testing

### Access Control
- Team data isolation
- User permission validation
- API endpoint security

### File Storage Security
- Private file access control
- Public file accessibility
- Cross-tenant data protection

## Integration Test Results

### Database Tests ✅
- Schema deployment: PASSED
- Foreign key validation: PASSED  
- Type conversion: PASSED
- Data integrity: PASSED

### API Tests ✅
- Credit endpoints: PASSED
- KB endpoints: PASSED
- File upload: PASSED
- Admin endpoints: PASSED

### Blob Storage Tests ✅

```

## Continuous Integration

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
test-phase3:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: Setup Database
      run: npm run db:push
    - name: Run Integration Tests
      run: npm run test:integration
    - name: Verify Build
      run: npm run build
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Production Monitoring
- API response time tracking
- Database query performance
- Background job success rates
- File storage operations

### Alert Thresholds
